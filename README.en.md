### !!! Special Tips !!!

Translation of the English version is still ongoing

So you can't find the English version at this time

<br>

### Project Introduction

Are you still checking the number of online players on MC servers by visiting [https://mcapi.us](https://mcapi.us) 

or using [MCBBS-[2021.12.6] To view the number of players online on MC servers with a web page](https://www.mcbbs.net/forum.php?mod=viewthread&tid=1281970)

It's time for a better tool, MCSCheckTool!

In this project, you can directly get:

Server Status | Number of players | Percentage of players | Server Logo | Server MOTD | Server version 

And you can customize the server IP and port you want to query, all from our interface! 

No need to open that annoying `JS` source code every time you change it

<br>

### How to use it

The official website address is [https://mcschecktool.rth1.app](https://mcschecktool.rth1.app)

You can also deploy the project yourself, the way is download the latest version in [Release](https://gitee.com/lingyunawa/mcschecktool/release) and deploy it to your own server
